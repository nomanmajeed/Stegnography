Steganography is simply the hiding of information within image data. In this project, you are to write a program in assembly language that allows a user to “hide” a string of arbitrary length within your image data. In this project, I have developed a program using x86 Intel Assembly Language that reads a PPM format image and store its pixels in an array. Then a phrase entered is endoced inside the pixels by altering Least Significant Bit (LSB) of each of RGB channel of image array. Also, a separate program was developed that decodes the phrase from the encoded PPM format image.
